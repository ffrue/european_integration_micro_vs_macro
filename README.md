WORK IN PROGRESS

Please open the main.ipynb in the "code" folder and follow the instructions to run the cells therein.
The Notebook then imports the different modules from "code" and uses the already prepared "full_dataset.csv" from the "results" folder. 
The "assets" folder contains figures to shown in the Notebook.
